# Round 1, Challenge 9

We are given the following peom. 

```
There once was a man
He was very important
Everyone knew this man
From country to country
Life to life
Animal to animal
God to god
I met him once
Seeing him brought a tear to my eye
He said if you want the flag
You have to look
Analyze everything
And I didn't miss a beat
I found the flag that day
But will you?
```

If we read the first letter of each sentence we get "THE FLAG IS HYAAIB". So, in this case the flag is **HYAAIB**
