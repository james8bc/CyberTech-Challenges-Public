# Round 1, Challenge 2, Got'em
Hey nerds, time for another writeup. This time it's going to be on challenge 2, "Got'em". We are linked to an audio file. If you listen to the audio file you will notice that there are two different channels. You can save the file by right clicking and selecting "Save audio as"

Lets throw it into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). We can now confirm that there are two different audio channels. Let's try throwing it into a spectrogram. You do this by clicking the black arrow next to "secret" on the left.

After doing that we get our flag.
