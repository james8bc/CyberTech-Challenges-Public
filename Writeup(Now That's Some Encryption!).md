# Round 1, Challenge 3, Now That's Some Encryption!

Hey guys, next writeup. This challenge is pretty easy. We have two strings, we have encrypted text and the key. Let's try this out on an [AES decryptor](https://aesencryption.net/). We put the encrypted text into the decryptor and we put the quote (without the quotes) into the key text box. Running the decryptor we get that the flag is **A35_13_3AsY**
