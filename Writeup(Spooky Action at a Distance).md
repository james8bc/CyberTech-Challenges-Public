Hey boys and girls, here is the next challenge writeup. We are given this photo and are told to find the flag.

Running the command "strings" doesn't yeild us anything of use, so it must be hidden in the photo some other way. Running zsteg on the image shows us the flag. The flag is **St3gaN0gRaPhY_is_N3At**
