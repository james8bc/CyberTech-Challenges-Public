# Round 1, Challenge 6, Extending An Olive Branch

We are given an exe file, the description of this challenge is "I found this weird file without an extension, I think it may be an exe file." The exe file does not run, so it might not be the right file type. Running the command "file" on the file reveals what it actually is. The file is a png file, from this, we can get the flag. The flag is **eXtEnSi0nS_ArE_C00l**
