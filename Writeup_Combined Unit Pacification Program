So the zip file is encrypted. The goal is to brute force this zip file with john.
In this challenge, you are supplied with a DOX. From this, you can build a password list

CUPP Password list. Run the following commands. 
git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
cd cupp
python3 cupp.py -i

Fill in the questions. For blank entries, just press enter. Make sure to accept all of the
extra options (add numbers and random symbols). Inside the cupp folder, there should be a
file called "jarold.txt". This is your word list.

ZIP file password hash. Now we need to get the hash of the zip file to brute force. The
following are commands.
zip2john file.zip > hash.txt

Finally, it is time to brute force the zip file. Run the following command.
john --format=zip --wordlist=mydictionary.txt myhash.txt

You will find that the password is "Paul2010". Enter the password into the zip file and
get the flag. The flag is: cUpP_1s_C00l
